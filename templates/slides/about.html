  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    This presentation is about the preliminary results for the development of a 
    Linked Data Fragment Server - built using Python and Redis - for providing a 
    lightweight mechanism for retrieving cached RDF triples for use by Semantic Web
    applications.

     <h2>The Problem</h2>
     <p class="intro">
      Providing a full SPARQL endpoint for both small and large RDF linked-data sets is 
      costly both in time and resources, especially for more complex queries. This 
      often results in poor responses and unreliable service, especially if the SPARQL 
      endpoint trying to handle multiple clients querying the RDF graph database.   
     </p>

     <h2>A Promising Alternative</h2>
    <a href="http://ruben.verborgh.org/">Ruben Verborgh</a> of <a href="">Ghent University</a> in 
    Belgium originated the concept of <a href="http://linkeddatafragments.org">Linked Data Fragments</a> 
    that offers a middle-ground between 
    different options for accessing RDF graph data. Instead of needing high-powered server to handle 
    the processing load required for hosting a full SPARQL endpoint or the alternative of just 
    providing a data dump where all of the data is processed locally to be useful, the Linked 
    Data Fragments approach
    instead offers a lightweight querying pattern called a 
    <strong>Triple Pattern Fragment</strong> that returns  one or more triples based on a simplified
    syntax.
