     <h3>Initial Design</h3>
     <p class="intro">
      The initial design of the Linked Data Fragments Server involved first converting 
      all subjects, predicates, and objects in our RDF graphs into SHA1 hashes and then 
      using the resulting digest as a key with the value being the original entity. For each
      triple in the RDF graph, a composite key is constructed with the subject SHA1 hash digest,
      predicate SHA1 hash digest, and object SHA1 hash digest separated by a colon ":" that was
      set as a key with the value being a JSON representation of the triple.

      Using the Redis <strong>KEYS</strong> command that supports glob pattern matching on the 
      entire datastore, triples can be retrieved using different patterns:
